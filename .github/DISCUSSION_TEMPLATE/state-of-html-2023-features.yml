    id: stability
    attributes:
      label: How stable is this feature?
      description: While the survey skews towards more recent and cutting edge features,
        we do plan to ask about certain stable features as well,
        to see how widely they're used and some future ones to gauge interest.
        "Shipped" refers to features that are available in stable versions of browsers, without being behind a flag or origin trial.
      options:
        - Future (No implementations yet)
        - Near Future (No shipped implementations yet, but at least one behind a flag)
        - Cutting edge (Shipped, but not in all browsers)
        - Recent (Shipped in all major browsers)
        - Stable (Widely supported for several years)
        - Controversial (Some shipped implementations, but some browsers have declined to implement)
        - Deprecated (Still supported, but not recommended for use in new projects)
        - Removed (No longer supported in any major browsers)
